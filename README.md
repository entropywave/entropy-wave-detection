## 🧠 Overview

This project proposes a novel framework for detecting global entropy fluctuations using passive monitoring of quantum coherence. The core idea is that correlated phase drift or decoherence in idle-mode superconducting qubits—measured across multiple labs—may indicate subtle, large-scale informational disturbances in the quantum vacuum.

> We treat coherence drift not as noise to be suppressed, but as a possible signal of field-level entropy dynamics.

## 🧪 Experimental Architecture (Summary)

- Superconducting qubits in idle-mode superpositions  
- GPS-synchronized logging of T₁, T₂, and phase drift  
- Environmental monitoring (EM, seismic, thermal)  
- Cross-lab correlation analysis and 5σ statistical validation  
- Monte Carlo simulations and blind injection protocols
